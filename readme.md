#London

this is a simple program to apply lightmaps to a location. Currently it's hardcoded to london

##Setup
build the c program to lightmap the images with `gcc munge.c -O2 -o munge` and then
give get4sq.py your api keys in order to be able to pull data from 4square. Run it
with python get4sq.py.

index.html will give you a simple html viewer for the data.
